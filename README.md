# C-Sharp
## The Problem
Code changes, one framework replaces another but something remains or at least slowly evolves.
Best practices, patterns, code organizing tips and tricks don't change as much. 
Internet is full of "best practices", blogs which often copies and quotes someone else.
Often with no examples or bad examples. Often without understanding the ideas well. 
It's rare to see a problem definition, issues of not resolving it, practical example of problem and solution to it all on code.
