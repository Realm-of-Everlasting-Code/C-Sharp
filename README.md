# C-Sharp
## The Problem
Code changes, one framework replaces another but something remains or at least slowly evolves.
Best practices, patterns, code organizing tips and tricks don't change as much. 
Internet is full of "best practices", blogs which often copies and quotes someone else.
Often with no examples or bad examples. Often without understanding the ideas well. 
It's rare to see a problem definition, issues of not resolving it, practical example of problem and solution to it all on code.

## Our Vision
We want to provide a single high-quality source of common code design problems and solutions to them.
Our goals:
- Unify people with love for beautiful code of all scopes and languages
- Share knowledge with others
- Learn from each other
- Single high-quality source for best practices and code design to be looked st with trust

## Scope
### Function
- A function should do one thing and do it well
- Reduce scope
- DRY
- Self-documenting code
- Comments
- Functional programming
### Class
- OOP
- SOLID
- Code smells
- KISS
### Project
- Design Patterns
- Dependencies
- Modular design, reusability

### Testing
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Design for testability
- TDD
  
We will not be discussing architecture because it is a different topic altogether.
